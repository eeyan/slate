# Welcome

Welcome to the BaaS by Green Dot API! 

You can use our API to take advantage of all of the features enabled by Green Dot's Banking as a Service platform. The 6 core APIs are:

 - [Enrollments](#enrollments)
 - [Users & Accounts](#users-and-accounts)
 - [Payment Instruments](#payment-instruments)
 - [Transfers](#transfers)
 - [ATM Locator](#atm-locator)
 - [Webhooks](#webhooks)

# Enrollments

## Overview

**Object:** /enrollments

The enrollments API or endpoint allows the partner to enroll a new User into a Product, create their Account, and their Payment Instrument (virtual or physical), with one single call.

This API stores encrypted user data such as name, address, social security number, date of birth, email address, and phone number, as well as account information, such as direct deposit information, account or purse information, and accountholder information.

By default, every user automatically has one primary purse that is designated for primary spending balance. A purse can be thought of as a balance container.

**Example:** When money is added to the customer’s account by direct deposit, the amount will automatically be credited to their primary purse.

A new user has the option to request a virtual or a physical card (payment instrument), only. To create an account with a virtual payment instrument only, the requestPhysicalCardFlag must be set to false in POST Enrollments or POST PaymentInstruments. *Note:* This flag will be defaulted to true if not provided.

A new user's initial status depends on the Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) requirements of the program.

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
